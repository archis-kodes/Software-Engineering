# Software Engineering Definition and Evolution
- It is a Systematic, desciplined, cost-effective techniques for Software Development.
- Engineering approach to develop a Software

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Planning
- Defining/Analysis
- Designing
- Coding/Implementation
- Testing
- Deploy/Maintainance

# Classical Waterfall Model
![Classical waterfall Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200330182523/Untitled-Diagram83.png)
<!--```
Feasibility Study
    ↳ Requirement Analysis and Specification
        ↳ Design
            ↳ Coding and Unit Testing
                ↳ System Testing and Integration
                    ↳ Maintainance
```-->
### Advantages
- Base Model
- Simple and Easy
- Small projects

### Disadvantages
- No Feedback
- No Experiment
- No Parallelism
- High Risk
- 60% Effort Maintainance

# Iterative Waterfall Model

        |━━|━━|━━↑━ Maintainance
```-->

### Advantages
- Base Model
- Simple and Easy
- Small projects
- Feedbacks [NEW!]

### Disadvantages
- No Feedback
- No Experiment
- No Parallelism
- High Risk
- 60% Effort Maintainance

# V-Shaped Model
![V shaped Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231030123258/software-Testing-SDLC-V-model.webp)
- Also known as Verification and Validation Model
- Extension of Waterfall model
- Testing is associated with every phase of lifecycle
- Verification Phase (Requirement Analysis, System Design, Architecture Design, Module Design)
- Validation Phase (Unit testing, Integration, System, Acceptance testing)

### Advantages
- Time saving
- Understanding of project at beginning
- Every component must be testable
- Progress can be tracked easily
- Proactive defect tracking

### Disadvantages
- No feedback so less scope of changes
- Risk analysis not done
- Not good for object-oriented projects
